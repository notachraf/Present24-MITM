# PRESENT24
- C implementation of PRESENT24 Encryption 
algoritme.
- Meet In The Middle attack on Double Present24.

## Overview
Present24 is an example of SPN (Substitutionâ€“permutation network)\
The number of rounds is fixed to 11, block size is 24 bits and the key size is also 24 bits. The non-linear layer is based on a single 4-bit S-box which was designed with hardware optimizations in mind. PRESENT is intended to be used in situations where low-power consumption and high chip efficiency is desired. 

## Compilation 
This implementation has only been tested on Windows and Unix platform.
1. Test Present24 Encryption and Decryption
    ```bash
    make present24
    ```
2. Perform Meet In The Middle attack 
    ```bash
    make mitm
    ```
    Used (plaintext, cipher) pairs :
    ```text
    (m1,c1) = (7e6359, 411b34) 
    (m2,c2) = (f55c52, 1c6195)
    ```

## Usage 
```bash
./bin/mitm [m1 c1 m2 c2] [number_of_threads]
```
